PAIN POINTS :
1. Currently, multiple Platforms (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, WeChat, Messenger, Piazza, iMessage, Snapchat) are being used concurrently for communication by Columbia students. These applications usually needs invite links to be invited or to be added to the various groups. Also for some platforms like WhatsApp, the invite link for a group needs to be generated everytime which makes in cumbersome. It is easy to miss messages between so many platforms and not everyone has an account on every platform.
2. Most of the platforms that are currently being used have a participation cap on groups. This currently cannot accomodate the large Columbia fraternity on a single platform and easily exclude people. For example, there are over 300 fall MS in Computer Science admits but Whatsapp groups have a cap of 256.
3. The security/access to groups on other platforms cannot be controlled, enabling non-affiliates of Columbia University with the link of the group to be added to the group and then spam on groups. People outside of Columbia (Scammers) can be added to the groups without any checks to prevent that.
4. People need to know about groups in advance or they need to know someone in the group to be invited. 
5. To make a group, we have to currently have the contact information of every person and then manually add them. Especially difficult for large courses or social gatherings, e.g. river cruise/computer science mixers/Engineering Software as a Service course.

PROPOSED SOLUTION (AND HOW IT HANDLES PAIN POINTS) :
1. ONE centralized platform used for all university-wide communication. This means you don't have to communicate through 10 different apps which is counterproductive and makes it easy to miss messages. Potentially embded Piazza/Ed into the webapp.
2. No participation cap on groups. No more "group is already full" messages!
3. Email check will be used to ALLOW only Columbia affiliates on the platform. No more scammers (and parents)!
4. In Columbia Chat, people can automatically get added to relevant course/social groups even if they don't know a single person in the group. Affiliates can  login and instantly have access to all the relevant social/course groups. Potential feature of SSOL login that will automatically generate user profile.
5. Allow groups to be discoverable within a certain radius - all eligible participants within that radius can see the group and join. Also generate a unique QR code for each group. Allow people to scan the QR code to be added to the group without exchanging contact information. Can also be used on flyers so people can join the group from the flyer. (Stretch Goal)

CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION FROM SOLUTIONS ON THE MARKET :
1. WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Messenger, WeChat have multiple groups for course related discussions and Piazza for ‘official’ communication but no place to have more ‘informal’ discussions about the course, workload, midterm planning etc.
2. Participating cap on WhatsApp (256), Messenger (250), WeChat(500) which can be easily tackled.
3. None of the platforms (except Discord) has a check to ALLOW only Columbia affiliates to be added on the platform. Discord needs admins to create groups. Users cannot create their own public/private groups and need to use another platform/server for that.
