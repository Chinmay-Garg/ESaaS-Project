IDEA : Columbia Wide Messaging/Planner App (Creative Name - Ideas?)

PAIN POINTS :
1. Multiple Platforms being used (WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, WeChat, Messenger, Piazza)
2. Participation cap on groups on platforms like WhatsApp.
3. Security/Access issues (Enabling random people to be added to the group that spam on groups)

PROPOSED SOLUTION (AND HOW IT HANDLES PAIN POINTS) :
1. ONE centralized platform being used for all university-wide communication.
2. No participation cap on groups.
3. Email check can be used to ALLOW only Columbia affiliates on the platform.

CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION FROM SOLUTIONS ON THE MARKET :
1. WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, Messenger, WeChat have multiple groups for course related discussions and Piazza for ‘official’ communication but no place to have more ‘informal’ discussions about the course, workload, midterm planning etc.
2. Participating cap on WhatsApp - 256 which can be easily tackled.
3. None of the platforms has a check to ALLOW only Columbia affiliates to be added on the platform.
